I am a fourth-year PhD student in the Laboratory for Information and Decision Systems (LIDS) at MIT, advised by [Professor Eytan Modiano](https://modiano.mit.edu/). My research involves modeling and analyzing theoretical problems in communication networks, with an emphasis on optimizing network performance. I am particularly interested in wireless networks and new challenges that arise with increasing mobile connectivity and real-time network applications. I am currently investigating the use of network slicing to provide service guarantees across multiple domains that include unreliable and changing wireless links. This is particularly useful for traffic with strict latency requirements, such as emergency response, real-time video, AR/VR, and autonomous control.

I received my Master's degree from MIT in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science in 2022. Before joining MIT, I received my Bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering from the University of Notre Dame in 2019.

My expected graduation is December 2025, and I am currently looking for an internship position for summer 2024.

In my spare time I enjoy running, traveling, and hiking in the New Hampshire White Mountains.
