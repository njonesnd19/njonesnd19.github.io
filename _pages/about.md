I am a fourth-year PhD student in the Laboratory for Information and Decision Systems (LIDS) at MIT, advised by [Professor Eytan Modiano](https://modiano.mit.edu/). My research involves modeling and analyzing theoretical problems in communication networks, with an emphasis on optimization and network control. I am particularly interested in wireless networks and new challenges that arise with increased connectivity and real-time network applications. I am currently investigating how software defined networks can improve service guarantees across multiple domains that include unreliable and changing wireless links. This is particularly useful for traffic with strict service requirements, such as emergency response, real-time video, AR/VR, and autonomous control.

I received my Master's degree from MIT in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science in 2022. Before joining MIT, I received my Bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering from the University of Notre Dame in 2019. My expected graduation is December 2025.

In my spare time I enjoy running, traveling, and hiking in the New Hampshire White Mountains.
