## About Me

I am a third-year PhD student in the Laboratory for Information and Decision Systems (LIDS) at MIT, advised by [Professor Eytan Modiano](https://modiano.mit.edu/). My research involves modeling and analyzing theoretical problems in communication networks, with an emphasis on optimization and network control. I am particularly interested in wireless networks and new challenges that arise with increasing mobile connectivity and real-time network applications. I am currently investigating the role of software defined networking (SDN) in multi-domain heterogeneous networks, and how SDN can improve end-to-end quality of service guarantees for different traffic classes.

I received my Master's degree from MIT in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science in 2022. Before joining MIT, I received my Bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering from the University of Notre Dame in 2019.

My expected graduation is fall 2025, and I am currently looking for an internship position for summer 2023.

In my spare time I enjoy running, traveling, and hiking in the New Hampshire White Mountains.
