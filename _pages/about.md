I am a third-year PhD student in the Laboratory for Information and Decision Systems (LIDS) at MIT, advised by [Professor Eytan Modiano](https://modiano.mit.edu/). My research involves modeling and analyzing complex theoretical problems in communication networks, with an emphasis on optimization and proving results in network control and performance. I am particularly interested in wireless networks and new challenges that arise with increasing mobile connectivity and real-time network applications. I am currently investigating the role of software defined networking (SDN) in multi-domain and possibly heterogeneous networks, and how SDN can improve end-to-end quality of service guarantees for different classes of traffic.

My expected graduation is fall 2025, and I am currently looking for an internship position for summer 2023.

In my spare time I enjoy running and hiking, and hope to complete all 48 New Hampshire 4000 footers before graduation.
