I am a PhD student in the Laboratory for Information and Decision Systems (LIDS) at MIT, advised by [Professor Eytan Modiano](https://modiano.mit.edu/). My research involves modeling and analyzing problems in communication networks, using tools from optimization, probability theory, and learning.

I received my Master's degree from MIT in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science in 2022. Before joining MIT, I received my Bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering from the University of Notre Dame in 2019.

My expected graduation is spring 2026.

In my spare time I enjoy running, traveling, and hiking.
